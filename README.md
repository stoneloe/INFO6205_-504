# GA Implementation of Auto-Composing Test Paper
This project is going to figure out a way to `compose test paper automatically` based on genetic algorithm. Like extracting 40 problems randomly from problem database to compose a paper whose total score is 100 and total difficulty is 0.75. 
In our project, entities in the process of composing paper like `problem`, `paper`, `population`(paper generation/a list of papers), `rule`(goals/expectations) are mapped into basic concept of genetic algorithm like `gene`, `unit`, `population`, then papers generated and envolved based on specific rules and expectations. Finally, the opitmized result would be got. The test final output is showed up below.
