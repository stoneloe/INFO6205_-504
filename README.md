# GA Implementation of Auto-Composing Test Paper
This project is going to figure out a way to compose test paper automatically based on genetic algorithm. Like extracting 40 problems randomly from problem database to compose a paper whose total score is 100 and total difficulty is 0.75. In our project, entities in the process of composing paper like problems, paper, population(paper generation/a list of papers), rule(goals/expectations), etc. are mapped into basic concept of genetic algorithm like gene, unit, population, etc. , then papers generated and envolved based on specific rules and expectations. Finally, the opitmized result would be got. The test fianl output is showed up below.
